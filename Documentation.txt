AI-Powered Learning Path Generator
Hybrid Recommendation + ML Ranking + RAG + LLM Integration
1. Introduction

The AI-Powered Learning Path Generator is a personalized roadmap generation system that combines:

Database-driven course retrieval

Machine Learning-based recommendation ranking

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning

Web-based interactive interface

The system generates structured learning paths based on a user’s:

Current skill level

Area of interest

Career goal

2. Problem Statement

Learners often struggle with:

Choosing the right starting point

Identifying structured progression

Understanding prerequisites

Aligning learning paths with career goals

This project solves the problem by combining traditional recommendation systems with LLM-based reasoning to generate structured, explainable learning roadmaps.

4. Project Modules
🔹 4.1 database.py

Responsible for:

Connecting to database

Fetching course data

Executing filtered queries

Returning structured course records

Key Responsibilities:

Data retrieval

Query abstraction

Data formatting for ML module

🔹 4.2 tables.py

Defines:

Database schema

Table structure

Column definitions

Example fields:

course_name

organization

difficulty

rating

category

Used during database initialization.

🔹 4.3 ml_recommendation.py

Implements machine learning-based scoring logic.

Features:

Course relevance scoring

Difficulty-level matching

Rating-weighted ranking

Interest similarity computation

Purpose:
To move beyond simple filtering and create intelligent course ranking.

🔹 4.4 recommendation.py

Acts as the orchestration layer.

Responsibilities:

Calls database module

Applies ML ranking

Returns ordered course list

Prepares formatted results for LLM

This forms the Hybrid Recommendation Engine.

🔹 4.5 llm.py

Handles:

LLM client initialization

Prompt engineering

Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Structured roadmap creation

Pipeline:

Receives ranked course data

Formats structured prompt

Sends to LLM (Gemini / GPT)

Generates:

Beginner roadmap

Intermediate progression

Advanced roadmap

Justifications

Suggested order

🔹 4.6 app.py

Streamlit-based web interface.

Features:

User input form

Level selection dropdown

Interest input field

Goal description field

“Generate Learning Path” button

Roadmap display section

Expandable recommendations

Provides interactive frontend for the system.

5. Technologies Used

Python

Streamlit

SQLite

Scikit-learn

Google Gemini API

dotenv for environment management

6. Hybrid Recommendation Strategy

The system combines:

1) Content-Based Filtering

Matches course topics with user interests.

2)ML-Based Ranking

Uses weighted scoring based on:

Rating

Difficulty match

Interest similarity

3) RAG + LLM Reasoning

Enhances recommendations by:

Structuring progression

Explaining course importance

Creating logical learning order

This creates a multi-layered intelligent system.

7. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is implemented by:

Retrieving relevant course data from database

Injecting structured course data into prompt

Using LLM to generate enriched roadmap

This prevents hallucination and ensures grounded output.

8. Security Practices

API keys stored in .env

.env excluded using .gitignore

No secrets stored in repository

Environment variable loading using dotenv

9.Installation & Setup
Clone Repository
git clone <repo_url>
cd ai-learning-path-generator
Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables

Create .env:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run Application
streamlit run app.py
